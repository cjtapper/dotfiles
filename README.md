# cjtapper's Dotfiles
- Managed with [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow)
- To install, `cd` into this directory.
- Run `stow dotfiles -t ~`.

## Tools
I haven't automated installation of these yet, but you get the idea.
- `fish`
    - `fisher` as plugin manager
- `git`
- `i3`
- `neovim`
- `sioyek` (minimal PDF viewer with vim keybindings)
- `starship`
- `tmux`
- `xterm`
- `zoxide` for better `cd`ing and autojump
- Probably many others

## Other steps
- `fisher update` to install fish plugins
